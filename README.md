--RequiCSense--

We are a team of four Computer Science students studying at Rollins College: Wolf Pickens, Christian Cassel, Andrej Opancic, Jack Filipanits. We are each passionate about our area of study in our own ways, but we are all passionate about creating games. Thusly, we wished to create an app that could both be an expression of our passion and provide something to fellow students like us—the very app you are using now.

RequiCSense (pronounced wreck-wii-sense) is intended to provide entertainment, brain stimulation, and even relaxation through the variety of minigame modules—especially for our fellow CS students. You will find multiple modules specifically dedicated to CS topics such as coding languages, binary, and CS lingo. Requii, the computer mouse companion, is there to help you keep track of your high scores, time spent per day, and record your weekly improvement. Be wary, however, for sometimes the computer mouse gets up to mischief of his own.
